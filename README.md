# cpp-compiler
Compiler for C++
The aim of this project is to build a compiler for the C++ programing language, using the C programming language. The compiler handles 'do', 'do-while' loops and 
'if' conditional statements. 
The phases of this project include:
1. Lexical Analysis - for the CFG
2. Syntactic Analysis - for the symbol table
3. Semantic Analysis - for AST
4. Intermediate Code Generation
5. Code Optimisation
6. Target Assembly Code Generation
